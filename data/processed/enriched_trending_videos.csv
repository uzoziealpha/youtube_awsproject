Lyrics: 
Call us what we are
Toxic from the start
Can‚Äôt pretend that I was in the dark 
When you met my friends
Didn‚Äôt even try with them
I should‚Äôve known it then that you were

Jealous and possessive 
So manipulating 
Honestly impressive
You had me participating

Back then
When I was running out of your place I said
I never wanna see your face
And then
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end

Ladies & Gentleman
I present to you, the ex

His favorite game is chess
Who would ever guess
Playing with the pieces in my chest 
Now he‚Äôs on the screen
Saying don‚Äôt leave
You stole that line from me
Cuz you‚Äôre just

Jealous and possessive
 So manipulating 
Honestly impressive
You had me participating
Back then
When I was running out of your place I said
I never wanna see your face
I meant
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer 
You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end

End end

I can‚Äôt forgive you for a lot of things
For not giving me back my Tiffany rings 
I‚Äôll never forgive you for one thing my dear
You wasted my prettiest years
Back then
When I was running out of your place I said
I never wanna see your face
I meant
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end

End end
We were toxic till the end 
End end

-91vymvIH0c,Doechii: Tiny Desk Concert,NPR Music,10,2024-12-06T17:00:06Z,370153,50815,4136,"Ashley Pointer | December 6, 2024
Doechii, known as the ""Swamp Princess,"" arrived at NPR HQ radiating confidence. She moved with purpose, knowing exactly what she wanted and how to achieve it. Her declarative statement, ""I'm everything,"" from ""BOOM BAP"" off her Grammy-nominated mixtape, ALLIGATOR BITES NEVER HEAL, was on full display in her Tiny Desk debut.

Backed by a full band, horns and two background singers, Doechii's performance was a masterclass in creativity. Sporting vintage academia looks, complete with matching cornrows and beads, Doechii delivers a freshly rearranged medley of cuts from ALLIGATOR BITES NEVER HEAL, tailored specifically for Tiny Desk. While hip-hop remained at the core, she truly gave us everything: a jazz arrangement of ""BOOM BAP,"" heavy rock vibes on ""CATFISH"" and a Southern praise break outro on ""NISSAN ALTIMA.""

She closed her set with ""Black Girl Memoir"" from her debut album, Oh The Places You'll Go. Before performing, she shared, ""I wrote this song specifically for Black women. As a dark-skinned woman, there's a very unique experience I'm trying to internalize ‚Ä¶ This is dedicated to all the beautiful Black women in the room."" While her star has been steadily on the rise since her debut, 2024 is shaping up to be the year Doechii cements herself as a household name.
